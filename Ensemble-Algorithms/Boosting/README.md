# Boosting

Boosting is a general ensemble method that creates a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers. This is done by building a model from the training data, then creating a second model that attempts to correct the errors from the first model. Models are added until the training set is predicted perfectly or a maximum number of models are added [1].

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) was the first really successful boosting algorithm developed for binary classification.
