# Logistic Regression

In regression analysis, logistic regression[[1]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2540383) (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (the coefficients in the linear combination). Formally, in binary logistic regression there is a single binary dependent variable, coded by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1", while the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). 

Logistic regression uses an equation as the representation, very much like linear regression.

$$\hat{y}=\frac{e^{b_0+b_1×x}}{1 + e^{b_0+b_1×x}}$$

The purpose of this study is to have knowledge on how Logistic Regression works.
