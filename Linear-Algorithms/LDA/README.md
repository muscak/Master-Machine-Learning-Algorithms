# Linear Discriminant Analysis

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)

The purpose of this project is to have knowledge on how LDA works.
