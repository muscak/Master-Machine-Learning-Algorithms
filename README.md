# Master Machine Learning Algorithms ðŸ“•

This is to practice the machine learning algorithms mentioned in the book [Master Machine Learning Algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/master-machine-learning-algorithms/) by Jason Brownlee. I'll first manually implement the algorithms using a generated sample data, then apply the related function from `sklearn` library, and finally apply that function to a sample previously collected dataset. The organization of this repository as follows:
