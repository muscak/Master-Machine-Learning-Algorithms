# Nonlinear Algorithms

Nonlinear algorithms assumes a nonlinear relationship between features and label. Thus, $f(x)$ can by a function of arbitrary complexity. The known algorithms are:

* Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
* Naive Bayes
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
* Support Vector Machines
