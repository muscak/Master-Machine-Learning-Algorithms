# Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)

In computer science, learning vector quantization (LVQ) is a prototype-based supervised classification algorithm[1]. LVQ is a family of algorithms for statistical pattern classification, which aims at learning prototypes (codebook vectors) representing class regions. The class regions are defined by hyperplanes between prototypes, yielding Voronoi partitions[2].
